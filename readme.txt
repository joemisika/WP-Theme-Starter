== Description ==
Theme Starter is a modernized theme starter pack using SASS, Twitter Bootstrap, Fontawesome etc and gulp to compile all into one file instead of having multiple css / js file. Doing this will give your WordPress theme a speed boost as it will mean loading a limited number of files instead of loading a fontawesome.css, bootstrap.css and a style.css.

== Installation ==
1. Create a folder - give it a name -  in your themes directory
2. Clone this repo into your folder(theme-folder-name) above
3. Change the name from Starter Theme in css/style.scss to your theme name or just run a search and replace for Starter Theme or Starter_Theme to your theme name.
4. In your admin panel, go to Appearance -> Themes and click the 'Add New' button.
5. Type in Theme Name in the search form and press the 'Enter' key on your keyboard.
3. Click on the 'Activate' button to use your new theme right away.
4. The theme doesn't come with much of a guide as its just barebones of using gulp with bootstrap & fontawesome
5. Code as desired.
